## Project Overview

To investigate behavioral and logistical factors contributing to patient no-shows, and provide data-driven recommendations for reducing missed appointments.


## Key Questions
- What days of the week have the highest no-show rates?

- Does receiving an SMS reminder reduce no-shows?

- Are younger patients more likely to miss appointments?

- Is there a correlation between wait time and no-shows?

- Do health conditions influence attendance?


## Dataset Description
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments)
- **Rows**: 110,000+records

| Table Name       | Description                       | 
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| PatientId        | Unique identifier for the patient | 
| AppointmentID    | Unique appointment ID | 
| Gender           | Male or Female | 
| ScheduledDay     | Date the appointment was scheduled | 
| AppointmentDay   | Actual day of the appointment |
| Age	           | Age of the patient |
| Neighbourhood	   | Location of the clinic |
| Scholarship	   | 1 = enrolled in welfare program |
| Hypertension	   | 1 = has hypertension |
| Diabetes	       | 1 = has diabetes |
| Alcoholism	   | 1 = recorded as alcoholic |
| Handcap	       | 0‚Äì4 (degree of disability) |
| SMS_received	   | 1 = patient got an SMS reminder |
| No-show	       | 1 = didn‚Äôt show up, 0 = came to the appointment |


## Data Cleaning 
‚úîÔ∏è Removed duplicates

‚úîÔ∏è Handled nulls and incorrect dates

‚úîÔ∏è Normalized column types

‚úîÔ∏è Created views for clean analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis 

‚úÖ Key Findings
| Metric           | Insights                      | 
|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| üìÖ Day of Week   | Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday had high no-show rates | 
| üì≤ SMS Reminder  | Surprisingly, those who received SMS reminders had more no-shows | 
| ‚è≥ Wait Time     | Longer wait time = higher no-show rate| 
| üßí Young Adults  | Most at-risk age group for missing appointments | 
| ü©∫ Health Conditions   | Not strong predictors of no-shows ‚Äî behavior > medical|


## SQL Techniques Used

- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

- CASE statements for bucketing and formatting

- Aggregations, groupings, and joins

- Derived metrics (no-show rate, wait time, age groups)

- Conditional formatting for visuals

## Tools Used
- Google BigQuery for data cleaning and transformation

- Looker Studio for visualization

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Monthly transaction and subscription volume trends  
- Distribution of users by plan and user type  
- Outlier detection in revenue and goal target amounts  
- Correlation between target amount and transaction frequency


## Key Business Insights

### Insight 1: Overall No-Show Rate 
**Purpose:** Measures scale of the problem

![image](./images/summary.PNG)

**Insight:**  
- Longer wait times correlated with higher no-show rates.
- High no-show rates occurred on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- Saturday had the highest no-show percentage (23%) but a very small sample size ‚Äî only 39 appointments.

### Insight 2: Wait Time (Days Between Booking and Appointment)

**Purpose:** Measure the number o waiting days between scheduled date and appointment date

![image](./images/wait%20time%20vs%20noshow.PNG)

**Insight:**  
- Longer wait times correlated with higher no-show rates.
- Patients who waited more than 7 days had nearly double the no-show rate (28%) compared to those with shorter wait times.

### Insight 3: No-Show Rate by SMS Reminder (Unexpected Trend)

**Purpose:** Tests effectiveness of SMS outreach and Compare those who got reminders vs. not

![image](./images/sms.PNG)

**Insight:**  
- Suprisingly 62.3% of patients who received SMS reminders missed their appointments vs 37.7% for those who didn‚Äôt receive SMS.
- Indicates that the current reminder strategy may not be effective or may even cause complacency.



### Insight 4: No-Show Rate by Age Group 

**Purpose:** Identifies at-risk age groups


![image](./images/age.PNG)

**Insight:**  
- Young adults exhibited the highest no-show rates, suggesting age-related behavioral trends.
- This age group may require targeted strategies to improve appointment adherence.
- Older adults (65+) had the lowest no-show rate (15.3%), indicating a potentially
different set of factors influencing their behavior.
- This age group may be a good target for outreach and engagement efforts.

### Insight 5: Day of Week Patterns

**Purpose:** Estimate ROI using total revenue minus assumed operating cost.

![image](./images/day_of_week.PNG)

**Insight:**  
- High no-show rates occurred on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.
- Saturday had the highest no-show percentage (23%) but a very small sample size ‚Äî only 39 appointments.
- This may indicate a scheduling bias or other factors at play.
- Further investigation is needed to understand these patterns.


## Data Visualization / Dashboard

A Looker Studio dashboard was created to summarize:
- Overall No-Show Rate	i.e % of total appointments missed
- No-Show Rate by Day of Week	i.e % missed per weekday
- No-Show Rate by Age Group i.e	% missed by age segments
- No-Show Rate by SMS Reminder	i.e Compare those who got reminders vs. not 
- No-Show Rate by Wait Time Bracket i.e	% missed based on wait duration
- Summary Table

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend:

1. Shorten wait times between booking and appointments
2. Test new SMS formats (e.g., conversational, emoji-rich, personalized)
3. Target young adults with behaviorally informed reminders or incentives
4. Add filters like day-of-week when overbooking to reduce loss
5. Invest in deeper behavioral research, not just medical profiling
6. Send SMS reminders to all patients, ideally 1 day before.
7. Consider offering flexible scheduling options for young adults

## Challenges Faced

- Interpreting user value with flat cost assumptions  
- Mock dataset lacked nuanced user behavior (e.g., churn signals)  
- Maintaining consistent joins and CTE logic across all queries  


## Next Steps / Future Work

- Add churn and lifetime value modeling  
- Automate profitability scoring using SQL procedures  
- Introduce clustering for user behavior segmentation  
- Develop goal conversion funnels and engagement scoring
